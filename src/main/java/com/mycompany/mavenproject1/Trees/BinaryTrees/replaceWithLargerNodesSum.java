/*
 * Given a binary search tree, you have to replace 
 * each node's data with the sum of all nodes which 
 * are greater or equal than it. You need to include the current node's data also.

That is, if in given BST there is a node with data 5,
you need to replace it with sum of its data (i.e. 5) 
and all nodes whose data is greater than or equal to 5.

Note: You don't need to return or print, just change the data of each node.

HINT : Since it’s a BST, the in-order traversal gives you nodes in sorted ascending order.

To handle “greater than or equal”, you need to visit nodes in descending order, i.e., reverse in-order traversal:
right → node → left

You keep a running sum as you traverse, adding the current node’s value and updating its data with that sum.
