    /*
     * You want to buy a ticket for a well-known concert which is happening in your
     * city. But the number of tickets available is limited. Hence the sponsors of
     * the concert decided to sell tickets to customers based on some priority.
     * 
     * A queue is maintained for buying the tickets and every person is attached
     * with a priority (an integer, 1 being the lowest priority).
     * 
     * The tickets are sold in the following manner -
     * 
     * 1. The first person (pi) in the queue requests for the ticket.
     * 2. If there is another person present in the queue who has higher priority
     * than pi, then ask pi to move at end of the queue without giving him the
     * ticket.
     * 3. Otherwise, give him the ticket (and don't make him stand in queue again).
     * Giving a ticket to a person takes exactly 1 second and it takes no time for
     * removing and adding a person to the queue. And you can assume that no new
     * person joins the queue.
     * 
     * Given a list of priorities of N persons standing in the queue and the index
     * of your priority (indexing starts from 0). Find and return the time it will
     * take until you get the ticket
     * Sample Input 1 :
     * 3
     * 3 9 4
     * 2
     * Sample Output 1 :
     * 2
     * Sample Output 1 Explanation :
     * Person with priority 3 comes out. But there is a person with higher priority
     * than him. So he goes and then stands in the queue at the end. Queue's status
     * : {9, 4, 3}. Time : 0 secs.
     * Next, the person with priority 9 comes out. And there is no person with
     * higher priority than him. So he'll get the ticket. Queue's status : {4, 3}.
     * Time : 1 secs.
     * Next, the person with priority 4 comes out (which is you). And there is no
     * person with higher priority than you. So you'll get the ticket. Time : 2
     * secs.
     * Sample Input 2 :
     * 5
     * 2 3 2 2 4
     * 3
     * Sample Output 2 :
     * 4
