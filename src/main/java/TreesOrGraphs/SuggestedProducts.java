/**
 *
 * @author ssingh You are given an array of strings products and a string
 * searchWord.
 *
 * Design a system that suggests at most three product names from products after
 * each character of searchWord is typed. Suggested products should have common
 * prefix with searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common
 * prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.
 *
 * Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of
 * searchWord is typed.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"],
 * searchWord = "mouse" Output:
 * [["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"]]
 * Explanation: products sorted lexicographically =
 * ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]. After typing m and mo all
 * products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]. After typing
 * mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"].
