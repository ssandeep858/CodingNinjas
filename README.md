# 📚 CodingNinja — Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my **CodingNinja** repository! This project is part of my journey to strengthen my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**, with a clear focus on mastering concepts crucial for **technical and coding interviews**.

---

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository is organized to provide a structured and efficient learning experience. Each core DSA concept is segregated into its respective folder, containing:
- 📌 Concept explanations (where applicable)
- 📝 Problem statements
- ✅ Java solutions with clean, readable code

Additionally, the repository will include:
- Popular problems from **LeetCode**
- The well-known **NeetCode 75** and **NeetCode 150** curated lists

The goal is to build a reliable resource for myself and for others preparing for coding interviews at top tech companies.
